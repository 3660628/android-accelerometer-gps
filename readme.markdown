Wanted to track my GPS coordinates in a battery-efficient fashion, without having to turn InstaMapper on and off throughout the day as I walk around. InstaMapper works great, but it keeps GPS on consistently. I also wanted to store coordinates locally (SQLite database) instead of relying on uploads to InstaMapper every N minutes.

This app is an attempt to use the accelerometer (pinging every 5 seconds) to detect movement. Only then will the app pull GPS coordinates. Currently this means GPS kicks on every 6 seconds, though I plan to make it configurable. So far the battery usage is much, much lower than InstaMapper.
